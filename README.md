# KeyStore
Figure out how to create a custom key store and generate certs for identity management solutions.

Two objectives â€” 
How do we generate a certificate (CSR), get it signed, and import it into a Java keystore that lives inside the Java install path? 
And Why would we do this?
How do we create and use a custom keystore outside such Java folders, including secure file layout, commands to build a PKCS#12 store from a key+cert chain, Tomcat config example, rotation steps and verification.
